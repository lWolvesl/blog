# Read research paper

- The purpose of reading papers is to get the most important information from the paper.

- 1.read the title, abstract, and figure
- 2.read the conclusion , figure - skim the rest
  (skim related work)
- 3.read but skip/skim math
- 4.whole thing but skip parts that don't make sense
  (we always don`t know which part is important)

- 5.Then, try to do some work:
  - 1.what does the author try to accomplish?
  - 2.what were the key element of the approach?
  - 3.what can you use in your work?
  - 4.what other reference do you want to follow?

- 6.read the paper again
